From previous exercises you could (should?) have gathered some interesting information: usernames and a mystical encoded string. If not, please, do previous exercises and concentrate on metadata. 

Hint: Most likely you have found a web-page (or pages) and picture (or pictures).
Tools: metadata can be extracted from a picture with exiftool, from web-page by looking it's source code

Now, let's do something with that data. 

1. Create a file users.txt and add usernames to that file (one per line).

Encoded string (decode it, cyberchef is your friend here) leads you to a traditional finnish song lyrics. There are four names in those lyrics!

2. Create all possible permutation of those four names (as they a written in finnish lyrics). Several permutation tools are available in the internet, e.g. https://www.dcode.fr/permutations-generator. You should get 24 different variations (product of 4 is 24, in finnish "kertoma").

3. Create a file passwds.txt and add generated strings to that file (one per line).

Now you have a list of possible usernames and a list of passwords to try in password list attacks. 

But what could be a suitable target for the attack?

In previous task you could (should?) have found a service that has http basic authentication... which means it  might be vulnerab√∂e to this kind of attacks.

Choose that device and service as your target.

Your aim is to access that service (find suitable credentials)!

Hint: These is several http basic authentication releted scripts in nmap (search nmap nse...).

4. Research suitable scripts and how to use those.
5. Check that your target is on-line and reachable (it may crash during this exercise...)
6. Attack.

Hint: You'll need to add suitable arguments to the nmap script to be able to hack the target. You have already created some files that you can use and you might have find even more information from the target system in previous exercises.

Good luck!
