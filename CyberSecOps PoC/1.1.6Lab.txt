Marriott Data Breach of 2018

Marriott International is the largest hotel chain in the world and they were victims of a phishing attack!
The victims of this attack were about 500 million customers of the hotel chain.
In the investigation Marriott found Remote access trojan along with MimiKatz a tool used for sniffing out username/passwords from a system.
Marriott noticed the attack in late 2018 when an internal security tool flagged a suspicious attempt to access guest information from the databases. Later it was found that the hack had been going on for 4 years.
The customer database was targeted which contained sensitive things like credit card information and passport numbers!
It was found out that the real criminals were infact state sponsered chinese hackers and that this hack was an attempt by the chinese government to create a data lake of information on American government employees and agents as Marriott is the top hotel provider for the US governmet and military.
The outcome of this breach was loss of customer data and sensitive information, none of the data was sold on the dark-web so it is very likely that it was stored by the chinese intelligence!
