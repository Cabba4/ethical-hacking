## Types of Malware

Ransomware - A type of malware where targets access to its data is disabled until a ransom is paid. The victim organization is rendered partially or totally unable to operate until it pays, but there is no guarantee that payment will result in the necessary decryption key or that the decryption key provided will function properly.

Example - RobinHood, WannaCry

FilelessMalware - Fileless malware doesn’t install anything initially, instead, it makes changes to files that are native to the operating system, such as PowerShell or WMI. 
Because the operating system recognizes the edited files as legitimate, a fileless attack is not caught by antivirus software — and because these attacks are stealthy, they are up to ten times more successful than traditional malware attacks.

Example - Astaroth

Spyware - Spyware collects information about users’ activities without their knowledge or consent. This can include passwords, pins, payment information and unstructured messages.

The use of spyware is not limited to the desktop browser: it can also operate in a critical app or on a mobile phone.

Example - DarkHotel

Adware - Adware tracks a user’s surfing activity to determine which ads to serve them. Although adware is similar to spyware, it does not install any software on a user’s computer, nor does it capture keystrokes.

Example - Fireball

Trojan - A Trojan disguises itself as desirable code or software. Once downloaded by unsuspecting users, the Trojan can take control of victims’ systems for malicious purposes. Trojans may hide in games, apps, or even software patches, or they may be embedded in attachments included in phishing emails.

Example - Emotet

Worms - Worms target vulnerabilities in operating systems to install themselves into networks. They may gain access in several ways: through backdoors built into software, through unintentional software vulnerabilities, or through flash drives. Once in place, worms can be used by malicious actors to launch DDoS attacks, steal sensitive data, or conduct ransomware attacks.

Example - Stuxnet

Other examples can be Mobile Malware, Wiper malware

## Emotet Malware

Emotet is a trojan that is primarily spread through spam emails. During its lifecycle, it has gone through a few iterations. Early versions were delivered as a malicious JavaScript file. Later versions evolved to use macro-enabled Office documents to retrieve a malicious payload from a C2 server.
